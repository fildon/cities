    <h1>Cities</h1>
    <p>
      A simple simulation of population centers. Small green cities can emerge
      at any time, so long as there is enough space. As new cities emerge, they
      will connect to neighbours. Once a city is connected to 3 others, it can
      "evolve" to a larger city. Larger cities can evolve again, but only when
      connected to 3 other cities of the same size or larger. If at any time a
      city has evolved, but is no longer connected to a smaller city, it dies
      out.
